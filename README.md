# MCQ-Group-Project

We initiated the development of an MCQ Project Module with a Spring Backend and Angular Frontend.

The Backend utilized Spring Boot with a MySQL database, managed by the Maven project management tool. For Authorization and Authentication, we employed Spring Security in the Backend, specifically the Basic Authentication method.

Regarding ORM, we used Hibernate with DDL auto-configuration, featuring One-to-One mapping between two tables and Many-to-One mapping with two others.

On the Frontend, we leveraged the Angular framework supported by Angular CLI. We used the HTTPInterceptor interface to intercept requests and add headers after authentication for communication with the Backend. Angular route guards were implemented for frontend authorization.

One significant challenge we encountered was integrating Spring Security into the application, particularly since the available tutorials were based on Version 5, whereas we used Version 6. This required some trial and error to ensure seamless integration between the Backend and Frontend.

Another obstacle we faced was with GitHub, but despite these challenges, we gained a deeper understanding of using branches, Pull Requests, and Git commands.

Overall, we acquired valuable hands-on experience and strengthened our sense of teamwork in a professional setting.
